<h1>Personal Portfolio</h1>
<br />
<br />
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    This project is meant to be a collection of my projects, containing those that I did at Flatiron as well as many more to come. Also contained are the blog posts that I had created for such projects directly from my Blogger site.
  
    The app has a rails backend with some seeding data as well as a React/Redux frontend in order to fetch the projects, comments, and blogs and display them in an orderly fashion.
